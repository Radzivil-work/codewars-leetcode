For example with social media we can find friends from all over the world and communicate with them, we can educate and study, we can build business in or with social media. Opposite them social media have a hard impact on self esteem and identity, in social media peoples generally show only the best of the best moments in life. We see only achievements but don’t see hard work behind this. This can make us feel Not good enough for life, because we see very much success in social media and start to feel insecure. Social media it’s a very big step in social communication, but I think where you find something there is lost something. We  have lost face-to-face meetings and that's very sad."
